#### Buttons
Buttons can be styled by applying the 'button' class to any <button> element.
```html
<button type="button" name="button" class="button">Default</button>
```

There are two types of buttons as of now; filled and non-filled.
To get a filled button we add the "filled" class to our button.
```html
<button type="button" name="button" class="button filled">Default filled</button>
```

> You can also edit the appearance of your button using any of simple.css' modifier classes. For an example check out the demo page.
