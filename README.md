### About
Simple.css is a simple CSS framework designed to be easy to work with and edit. It is entirely open source and free for anyone to use. It is currently in development; however, if you'd like to follow its progress you can do so [here](http://cpdev.me/simple.css/).

### Development

Happy coding!

### Components
List of components can be found [here](https://github.com/cpdevelops/simple.css/tree/master/src/components)

##### Button Component
Buttons can be styled by applying the `button` class to any `<button>` element.

```html
<button type="button" class="button">Default</button>
```

There are two types of buttons as of now; filled and non-filled. To get a filled button we add the "filled" class to our button.

```html
<button type="button" class="button filled">Default filled</button>
```

> You can also edit the appearance of your button using any of Simple.css' modifier classes. For example, check out the demo page.
